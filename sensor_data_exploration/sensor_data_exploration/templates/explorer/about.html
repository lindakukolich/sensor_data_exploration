<p><a href="http//thompsonisland.org">Thompson Island Outward Bound Education Center</a> is a not-for-profit organization whose primary purpose is to provide adventurous and challenging experiential learning programs that inspire character development, compassion, community service, environmental responsibility and academic achievement. Our organization principally serves early adolescents from all economic and social communities of greater metropolitan Boston, and the institutions and adults who support them
<p>
Located in the Boston Harbor Islands National Park area, Thompson Island Outward Bound Education Center serves more than 4000 Boston Public School (BPS) students each year in experiential learning programs. Only one mile from Boston, but a million miles from urban life, Thompson Island is an ecologically diverse, 204-acre island of beaches, marshes, meadows and forests that is being preserved, studied and used as an outdoor classroom by the students of Boston. Thompson Island Outward Bound Education Center and its partners at the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/boha/historyculture/facts-thom.htm">National Park Service</a>, <a href="http://www.cesn.org/thompson.php">UMass Boston</a>, <a href="http://thompson.nortek.no/">Nortek</a> and Wildlife Acoustics have each installed environmental sensors on Thompson Island. Data from weather stations and buoys, hydrologic sensors, audio recording devices, video cameras, and more is all being broadcasted remotely by cellular, wireless and satellite technology. Each instrument has its own mechanism for data access and many provide different data types, making it extremely difficult for participants in Thompson Island programs to easily access all the data or to compare information from different data sources.
<p>
This website, however, has been created by a team of MIT alumni in order to bring data together in one place and make it exciting and fun for students to explore. This site is intended to bridge science and technology in order to extend Thompson Island Outward Bound field science learning expeditions back into BPS classrooms. Educators realized that seamless access to data collected on Thompson Island will infuse more math and greater scientific rigor into the curriculum. The data will both inspire and answer questions, and deepen thinking about the island and the environment.
<p>
The primary users for this site are middle school (5th to 8th grade) students and their educators (BPS teachers, Thompson Island Outward Bound instructors, National Park Service (NPS) rangers). Additional users also include Thompson Island staff, UMass Boston and national park researchers. Finally, visitors to Thompson Island, Boston area residents, and science buffs in general will also find the data fascinating and useful.
